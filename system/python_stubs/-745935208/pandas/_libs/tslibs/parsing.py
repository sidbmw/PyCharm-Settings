    Parse a string in one of the supported formats, using the
        ``parserinfo`` parameters.
    
        :param timestr:
            A string containing a date/time stamp.
    
        :param parserinfo:
            A :class:`parserinfo` object containing parameters for the parser.
            If ``None``, the default arguments to the :class:`parserinfo`
            constructor are used.
    
        The ``**kwargs`` parameter takes the following keyword arguments:
    
        :param default:
            The default datetime object, if this is a datetime object and not
            ``None``, elements specified in ``timestr`` replace elements in the
            default object.
    
        :param ignoretz:
            If set ``True``, time zones in parsed strings are ignored and a naive
            :class:`datetime` object is returned.
    
        :param tzinfos:
            Additional time zone names / aliases which may be present in the
            string. This argument maps time zone names (and optionally offsets
            from those time zones) to time zones. This parameter can be a
            dictionary with timezone aliases mapping time zone names to time
            zones or a function taking two parameters (``tzname`` and
            ``tzoffset``) and returning a time zone.
    
            The timezones to which the names are mapped can be an integer
            offset from UTC in seconds or a :class:`tzinfo` object.

        :param dayfirst:
            Whether to interpret the first value in an ambiguous 3-integer date
            (e.g. 01/05/09) as the day (``True``) or month (``False``). If
            ``yearfirst`` is set to ``True``, this distinguishes between YDM and
            YMD. If set to ``None``, this value is retrieved from the current
            :class:`parserinfo` object (which itself defaults to ``False``).
    
        :param yearfirst:
            Whether to interpret the first value in an ambiguous 3-integer date
            (e.g. 01/05/09) as the year. If ``True``, the first number is taken to
            be the year, otherwise the last number is taken to be the year. If
            this is set to ``None``, the value is retrieved from the current
            :class:`parserinfo` object (which itself defaults to ``False``).

            Whether to allow fuzzy parsing, allowing for string like "Today is

            will return a tuple where the first element is the parsed
            :class:`datetime.datetime` datetimestamp and the second element is

        :return:
            Returns a :class:`datetime.datetime` object or, if the
            ``fuzzy_with_tokens`` option is ``True``, returns a tuple, the
            first element being a :class:`datetime.datetime` object, the second
            a tuple containing the fuzzy tokens.

class relativedelta(object):
    """
    The relativedelta type is based on the specification of the excellent
        work done by M.-A. Lemburg in his
        `mx.DateTime <https://www.egenix.com/products/python/mxBase/mxDateTime/>`_ extension.
        However, notice that this type does *NOT* implement the same algorithm as
        his work. Do *NOT* expect it to behave like mx.DateTime's counterpart.
    
        There are two different ways to build a relativedelta instance. The
        first one is passing it two date/datetime classes::
    
            relativedelta(datetime1, datetime2)
    
        The second one is passing it any number of the following keyword arguments::
    
            relativedelta(arg1=x,arg2=y,arg3=z...)
    
            year, month, day, hour, minute, second, microsecond:
                Absolute information (argument is singular); adding or subtracting a
                relativedelta with absolute information does not perform an arithmetic
                operation, but rather REPLACES the corresponding value in the
                original datetime with the value(s) in relativedelta.
    
            years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds, microseconds:
                Relative information, may be negative (argument is plural); adding
                or subtracting a relativedelta with relative information performs
                the corresponding aritmetic operation on the original datetime value
                with the information in the relativedelta.
    
            weekday: 
                One of the weekday instances (MO, TU, etc). These
                instances may receive a parameter N, specifying the Nth
                weekday, which could be positive or negative (like MO(+1)
                or MO(-2). Not specifying it is the same as specifying
                +1. You can also use an integer, where 0=MO. Notice that
                if the calculated date is already Monday, for example,
                using MO(1) or MO(-1) won't change the day.
    
            leapdays:
                Will add given days to the date found, if year is a leap
                year, and the date found is post 28 of february.
    
            yearday, nlyearday:
                Set the yearday or the non-leap year day (jump leap days).
                These are converted to day/month/leapdays information.
    
        There are relative and absolute forms of the keyword
        arguments. The plural is relative, and the singular is
        absolute. For each argument in the order below, the absolute form
        is applied first (by setting each attribute to that value) and
        then the relative form (by adding the value to the attribute).
    
        The order of attributes considered when this relativedelta is
        added to a datetime is:
    
        1. Year
        2. Month
        3. Day
        4. Hours
        5. Minutes
        6. Seconds
        7. Microseconds
    
        Finally, weekday is applied, using the rule described above.
    
        For example
    
        >>> dt = datetime(2018, 4, 9, 13, 37, 0)
        >>> delta = relativedelta(hours=25, day=1, weekday=MO(1))
        datetime(2018, 4, 2, 14, 37, 0)
    
        First, the day is set to 1 (the first of the month), then 25 hours
        are added, to get to the 2nd day and 14th hour, finally the
        weekday is applied, but since the 2nd is already a Monday there is
        no effect.

        See `Sources for Time Zone and Daylight Saving Time Data
        <https://data.iana.org/time-zones/tz-link.html>`_ for more information.
        Time zone files can be compiled from the `IANA Time Zone database files
        <https://www.iana.org/time-zones>`_ with the `zic time zone compiler
        <https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=zic&sektion=8>`_
    
        .. note::
    
            Only construct a ``tzfile`` directly if you have a specific timezone
            file on disk that you want to read into a Python ``tzinfo`` object.
            If you want to get a ``tzfile`` representing a specific IANA zone,
            (e.g. ``'America/New_York'``), you should call
            :func:`dateutil.tz.gettz` with the zone identifier.
    
    
        **Examples:**
    
        Using the US Eastern time zone as an example, we can see that a ``tzfile``
        provides time zone information for the standard Daylight Saving offsets:
    
        .. testsetup:: tzfile
    
            from dateutil.tz import gettz
            from datetime import datetime
    
        .. doctest:: tzfile
    
            >>> NYC = gettz('America/New_York')
            >>> NYC
            tzfile('/usr/share/zoneinfo/America/New_York')
    
            >>> print(datetime(2016, 1, 3, tzinfo=NYC))     # EST
            2016-01-03 00:00:00-05:00
    
            >>> print(datetime(2016, 7, 7, tzinfo=NYC))     # EDT
            2016-07-07 00:00:00-04:00
    
    
        The ``tzfile`` structure contains a fully history of the time zone,
        so historical dates will also have the right offsets. For example, before
        the adoption of the UTC standards, New York used local solar  mean time:
    
        .. doctest:: tzfile
    
           >>> print(datetime(1901, 4, 12, tzinfo=NYC))    # LMT
           1901-04-12 00:00:00-04:56
    
        And during World War II, New York was on "Eastern War Time", which was a
        state of permanent daylight saving time:
    
        .. doctest:: tzfile
    
            >>> print(datetime(1944, 2, 7, tzinfo=NYC))    # EWT

    ``tzstr`` objects are time zone objects specified by a time-zone string as

        There is one notable exception, which is that POSIX-style time zones use an
        inverted offset format, so normally ``GMT+3`` would be parsed as an offset
        3 hours *behind* GMT. The ``tzstr`` time zone object will parse this as an
        offset 3 hours *ahead* of GMT. If you would like to maintain the POSIX
        behavior, pass a ``True`` value to ``posix_offset``.
