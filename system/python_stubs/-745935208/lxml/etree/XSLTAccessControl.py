        Access control for XSLT: reading/writing files, directories and
        network I/O.  Access to a type of resource is granted or denied by
        passing any of the following boolean keyword arguments.  All of
        them default to True to allow access.
    
        - read_file
        - write_file
        - create_dir
        - read_network
        - write_network
    
        For convenience, there is also a class member `DENY_ALL` that
        provides an XSLTAccessControl instance that is readily configured
        to deny everything, and a `DENY_WRITE` member that denies all
        write access but allows read access.
    
        See `XSLT`.
